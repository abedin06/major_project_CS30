 - the game was pretty good design-wise but improvement like satelite color changer,
  level replay option, endgame score tracker, and a good main menu can be made.
  I feel like having the option to change the mass of the satelite to make the game have various difficulties
  would add more fun into the game as well.
# CS Person
- controls seem a little sensitive at times
- unclear whether the arrow keys apply thrust or rotate nose cone
- the rocket is abut small for a main character
- the asteroids seem to be more of a distractions
- for someone who wants to minimize their death count the instant restart makes it so hard
- no start or end screen
