# Project Description

I am trying to build a Physics game based on steering and launching satellites. The player has
to use his Physics knowledge to steer the satellite or chart a course in order to accomplish a given mission.

# Needs to have

- Create a spaceship or satellite with vector positions
- Make the satellite move and accelerate on command.
- Add realistic gravity, air resistance or any other forces.
- Make planets and outerspace environment.
- Add collisions and explosions
- Limited fuel or ratings based on fuel efficiency
- Sound effects and a start screen.

# Nice to have List

- Having 3D planets and 3D spaceships/satellites
- Making the objects move in 3D
