# Reflection

# What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

- Plan out things more elaborately. Having a clear picture of how you want your game to look like
helps to code the things you want. Learn about using translate and how to move things around after going off-screen.
Use class time more effectively so that the tough things are not left till the end. If you are using complex physics, make
a seperate JS file and link it to the original code.

# Did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?

- Yes, I have completed everthing on my needs to have list but none from my nice to have list

# What was the hardest part of the project?

- It was the small errors (silly logic errors, image pathways, preload functions) that complete break your code or runs the loop in opposite direction that were the toughest to fix as they could not be spotted easily. Fixing bugs (planet clipping the planet and the levels clearing by themselves) were also pretty tough to fix.

# Were there any problems you could not solve?

- I wanted to make a first level where the user would launch the rocket from Earth and the rocket would follow the "rocket equation"
taking exhaust velocity, mass loss, air resistance and gravity into consideration. I got the equation done but implementing it into the code was a bit too difficult as the values did not match the actual results. So not being able to implement the rocket equation was a problem I could not solve
